# code-wars
My Codewars submissions.

A Github repository to document my Python Katas from codewars.com

Every file is a single Kata and every Kata should contain the description for the respective Kata for context.

Feel free to use my solutions.

Any and all feedback regarding optimisation and best practices for my code is welcome.
